What is Dwardle?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

Dwardle is a new Social Network / Micro blogging service which is currently in development powered by the 
CodeIgniter Framework by EllisLabs. The Dwardle application is coded by a 21 year old web developer named Paul 
Chater whos website(s) can be found at:

When will Dwardle be finished and will it be free?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

I currently have no set date on when Dwardle will be finished, although i'm planning on pushing out a Private 
Alpha around Mid to Late November 2009.

Yes, of course Dwardle will be free. The only thing that we would be charging for may be donations, but that will 
not be a required commitment. Small donations will be going into a personal fund which pays for the server to run 
Dwardle.



What is the Dwardle Policy?
================================================================================================================
================================================================================================================

The Dwardle Code is not allowed to be used on LIVE servers although it can be downloaded and run on a local host 
to learn from. Dwardle isn't currently an Open Source Application, although admittedly that is a bit hypocritical 
considering that it is on a Public Git Repository (this will be changed Friday 31st July 2009.)

If you are planning to run Dwardle on a local host to learn from then you must contact Paul Chater immediately 
via either msn messenger, email or by a direct message on twitter. Contact details are below.
